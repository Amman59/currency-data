I havent been on here for a while - largely because of a combination of work and extracurricular activities taking up a lot of my time (most notably my Charter exams). I will try to use this repository to work with live data, specifically currencies and ER data.Im not entirely sure that this is possible on github codespaces, but if I can get it to work then I can have more fun playing with data.
